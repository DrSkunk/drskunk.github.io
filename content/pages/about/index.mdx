<h1>So what's the deal with your hair?</h1>
<p>
  So right, I get asked this a lot. I have an autoimmune skin condition called
  vitiligo which makes patches of skin lose their pigment. Sometimes the hair on
  that spot becomes white, which you can see on my head. So no, it's not
  contagious and no, I don't dye my hair.
