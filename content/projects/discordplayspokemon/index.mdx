Server application made in Typescript that allows a Discord server to play a Game Boy game using only a text channel. The bot posts a frame of the game and the players vote which button should be pressed by reacting on the post with the corresponding emoji.

Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DrSkunk/discord-plays-pokemon) for instructions on how to install and add to your own server.

Commands for Pokémon include:

- `-frame`: Post a frame from the emulator and wait for user input.
- `-map`: Create a map with your current position
- `-info`: Read detailed info from the emulator's RAM like Pokémon stats.

Every two hours a GIF summary is made from all rendered frames.
