Tik Tak is the name of the children's show for Flemish television. For some parts of the show custom parts were 3D printed, lasercut and combined with Arduino modules and mostly off-the-shelf components. Models were designed with Fusion360 and edited with Inkscape. Parts were printed with an Ultimaker 3 and laser cut with a Trotec Speedy 300.
